The Fitness Manager application allows athletes to create
a variety of workouts.  There are categories to seperate
different types of exercises.  If an exercise is click on
a video will display with a demostration of the exercise.  
To create a workout an athlete has to register or login by
simply entering a username.  An athlete must choose between
1 and 6 exercises.
    Future upgrades include being able to create exercises
and customize demo videos for exercises.  Also being able
to modify the categories or create new ones.  Secure password
login and OAuth registration will also be added.
