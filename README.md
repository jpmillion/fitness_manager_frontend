The Fitness Manager application allows athletes to create a variety of workouts. There are three different categories (Strength, Plyometric, and Speed & Agility) to select from when choosing exercises. Clicking on the name of an exercise will display a video that will demostrate the exercise. Athletes can create as many workouts as they want. Workouts must have between 1 and 6 exercises. An Athlete can log in or register by simply entering a unique username.

Future upgrades include being able to create and update exercises and their attributes such as name and video url. Also, creating and editing categories and their attributes. These upgrades will allow an Athlete to customize there page if the default is not to their liking. Secure login and OAuth will also be added to the application.
